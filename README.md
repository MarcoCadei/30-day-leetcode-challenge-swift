# 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge in **Swift**

In this repo I want to provide my solutions to the [30-Day LeetCoding Challenge](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/551411/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge) using **Swift**.

I use Swift in my day to day work as iOS Software Engineer, but I've never used it for these kinds of challenges and I thnk it's rarely used in this scope. However, given the great flexibility and power of the language I want to try it in this environment. 
I bet I will learn tons of things. ðŸ’ª

## The challenge

For each day of the challenge I have setup a folder which contains the *playground* with the solution and a *README.md* with the original text given by *LeetCode* and how I approached the problem.

### Solutions
- [Day 01](https://github.com/MarcoCadei/30-day-leetcode-challenge-swift/tree/master/day01)
- [Day 02](https://github.com/MarcoCadei/30-day-leetcode-challenge-swift/tree/master/day02)
- [Day 03](https://github.com/MarcoCadei/30-day-leetcode-challenge-swift/tree/master/day03)
